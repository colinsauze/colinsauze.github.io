    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
    Most of my research has involved applying algorithms inspired by the mamallian endocrine system to manage power and competing demmands in autonomous robots. This lets the robot gradually adjust its behaviour as the conditions it operates in change. One example of this is to reduce the amount we move actuators or the speed the robot travels at, as the batteries get flat.

    <p>Related to this i'm interested in developing autonomous sailing robots as oceanographic observation platforms, which can stay at sea for weeks or months at a time and gather data about the water. To stimulate research in this area we've been trying to have a race called the <a href="http://www.microtransat.org/">Microtransat Challenge</a>, across the Atlantic with autonomous sailing robots. We made an attempt at this in 2010 (see <a href="http://microtransat.wordpress.com">our sailing robot blog</a> for more on this), but it only lasted a few days. Several others have tried since but they haven't been much more successful. There is also an annual series of short races called the <a href="http://www.roboticsailing.org">World Robotic Sailing Championships</a> where sailing robots can compete against each other without (much) risk of being lost at sea. I ran this competition in Cardiff in 2012 along with the associated International Robotic Sailing Conference.</p>
